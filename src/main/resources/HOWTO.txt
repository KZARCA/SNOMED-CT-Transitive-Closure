This HOWTO describes how to use the installer scripts to load SNOMED into a database.

Prerequisites
-------------
If loading transitive closure table into a database, first load SNOMED in RF2
using the database load scripts you can also find at the URL above.  This is
important because it creates a view that allows for denormalization of preferred
concept names, thus making the transitive closure table more useful.

Also, the load scripts for Oracle and MySQL both assume that the transitive closure
file has been created in a specific location with a particular filename. See the
default settings at the top of the transitive closure scripts for more info.

Installation
------------
1. Download the SNOMED CT Release files
    in ZIP format.  US Users can find the files here:
  * SNOMED CT® US Edition Release Files: 
    * http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/Snomed/us_edition.html
  * SNOMED CT® International Edition Release Files: 
    * http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/snomedctfiles.html

2.  Unzip the files into a folder

3.  Unzip the transitive closure tools to another folder

4.  For the desired format, copy the appropriate installer scripts 
    to the release file directory as specified below:
* For RF1, copy the installer scripts from rf1/ to the folder from step 2
* For RF2, copy the installer scripts from rf2/ to the folder from step 2
	  
5. Run the corresponding .bat or .sh script for your environment and it will 
   generate the transitive closure file.  See the script for the output file
   location and name.

Optional Steps - Database Load
------------------------------
PREREQUISITES: The database load script tooling available from 
  http://www.westcoastinformatics.com/resources.html has already been run and the
  database loaded.  This is "add on" functionality to an existing load.

0.  This assumes the steps in the previous section have been completed.

1.  Copy the appropriate installer scripts from rf1/ or rf2/
	and paste them into the directory you unpacked SNOMED CT data 
	files into.  You may have already completed this from the prior section.
	
2.  Depending on your platform and database, choose the 
    appropriate "populate" script.  For example:
  * For MySQL on Windows, use the "populate_mysql_db_tc.bat" script
  * For Oracle on Windows, use the "populate_oracle_db_tc.bat" script
  * For MySQL on Linux/Unix/MacOS, use the "populate_mysql_db_tc.sh" script
  * For Oracle on Linux/Unix/MacOS, use the "populate_oracle_db_tc.sh" script
  
3. Configure the settings at the top of the script for your environment

4. Execute the script
  * Note: a complete log file will appear as "mysql.log" or "oracle.log"
