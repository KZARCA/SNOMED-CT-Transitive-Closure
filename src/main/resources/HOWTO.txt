This HOWTO describes how to use the installer scripts to load SNOMED into a database.

Prerequisites
-------------
If loading transitive closure table into a database, first load SNOMED in RF2
using the database load scripts you can also find at the URL above.  This is
important because it creates a view that allows for denormalization of preferred
concept names, thus making the transitive closure table more useful.

Also, the load scripts for Oracle and MySQL both assume that the transitive closure
file has been created in a specific location with a particular filename. See the
default settings at the top of the transitive closure scripts for more info.

Installation
------------
1. Download the SNOMED CT International Release files and unzip into a folder
    in ZIP format.  US Users can find the files here:
  * SNOMED CT® US Edition Release Files: 
    * http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/Snomed/us_edition.html
  * SNOMED CT® International Edition Release Files: 
    * http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/snomedctfiles.html
  * SNOMED CT® International Edition Archive Files
    * http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/snomedctarchive.html

2. Unzip the transitive closure tools into a folder (ideally the RF2Release or
   RF1Release folder of the SNOMED CT distribution you are using).

3. Edit the transitive_closure script (either .bat or .sh depending on your envrioment)
  * Set the path to the RF2, snapshot, inferred SNOMED CT relationships file
    or to the RF1 SNOMED CT relationships file
  * Set the path to the output file (if using the database load scripts, make sure the
     output file winds up in the same directory as the input relationships file and
     with a naming convention consistent with that of the other SNOMED files)

4. Run the script and it will generate the transitive closure file.

Optional Steps - Database Load
------------------------------
PREREQUISITES: The database load script tooling available from 
  http://www.westcoastinformatics.com/resources.html has already been run and the
  database loaded.  This is "add on" functionality to an existing load.

1.  Copy the appropriate installer scripts from rf1/ or rf2/
	and paste them into the RF2Release or RF1Release directory, respectively
	
2.  Set the variables in the script, such as database username/password.

3.  Depending on your platform and database, choose the 
    appropriate "populate" script.  For example:
  * For MySQL on Windows, use the "populate_mysql_db_tc.bat" script.
  * For Oracle on Windows, use the "populate_oracle_db_tc.bat" script.
  * For MySQL on Linux/Unix/MacOS, use the "populate_mysql_db-tc.sh" script.
  * For Oracle on Linux/Unix/MacOS, use the "populate_oracle_db-tc.sh" script.
  
4. Configure the settings at the top of the script for your environment

5. Execute the script
  * Note: a complete log file will appear as "mysql.log" or "oracle.log"
